# UmapSlicer

Just a repository to show my attempts at creating G-Code generation software.
**Umap** is standing for *Unit of Multidimensional Automated Printing*, this is my project that tries to understand the intricacies of the work with 3D printers and a creation of a basic 3D printer. UmapSlicer - a part of this project responsible for generating of printing files, also called G-Code.
